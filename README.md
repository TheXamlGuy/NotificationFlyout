# Getting started #
The majority of this guide refers to the [Host a custom WinRT XAML control in a WPF app using XAML Islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/host-custom-control-with-xaml-islands) article. 

## Create a WPF project ##
1. In Visual Studio 2019, create a new UWP app project project. Make sure the target version and minimum version are both set to Windows 10, version 1903 (Build 18362) or a later release.
2. In the UWP app project, install the Microsoft.Toolkit.Win32.UI.XamlApplication NuGet package (latest stable version).
3. Open the App.xaml file and replace the contents of this file with the following XAML. Replace MyUWPApp with the namespace of your UWP app project.
```xaml
<xaml:XamlApplication
    x:Class="MyUWPApp.App"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:xaml="using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Win32.UI.XamlHost"
    xmlns:local="using:MyUWPApp">
</xaml:XamlApplication>
```
4. Open the App.xaml.cs file and replace the contents of this file with the following code. Replace MyUWPApp with the namespace of your UWP app project.
```c#
namespace MyUWPApp
{
    public sealed partial class App : Microsoft.Toolkit.Win32.UI.XamlHost.XamlApplication
    {
        public App()
        {
            this.Initialize();
        }
    }
}
```
5. In the UWP app project, install the [NotificationFlyout.Uwp.UI.Controls](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NotificationFlyout.Uwp.UI.Controls/) NuGet package (latest stable version).
3. Open the MainPage.xaml file and replace the contents of this file with the following XAML. Replace MyUWPApp with the namespace of your UWP app project.
```xaml
<controls:NotificationFlyout
    x:Class="Test.MainPage"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:controls="using:NotificationFlyout.Uwp.UI.Controls"
    IconSource="/Assets/Icon.ico"
    LightIconSource="/Assets/Icon-Light.ico">
    <Grid Width="400" Height="500">
        <Button
            HorizontalAlignment="Center"
            VerticalAlignment="Center"
            Content="Hello World!" />
    </Grid>
</controls:NotificationFlyout>
```
5. In the UWP app project, add two icons (.ico) to the Assets folder.
6. Place the icon names of `IconSource` and `LightIconSource` with the names of the icons that you have added to your Assets folder.

# Limitations and workarounds #
All limitions found in this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/xaml-islands#limitations-and-workarounds) will affect how you build an app using this control. We have of course have added a work around for when the Windows theme is changed by the user ðŸŽ‰!
